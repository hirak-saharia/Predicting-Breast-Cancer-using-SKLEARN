# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-using-SKLEARN
Phase 0 — Data Preparation. We will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer dataset.
Phase 1 — Data Exploration
Phase 2 — Categorical Data
Splitting the dataset
Phase 3 — Feature Scaling
Phase 4 — Model Selection
We have different types of classification algorithms in Machine Learning :-
We will use RandomForestClassifier.
Finally, Trained the Random Forest model using sklearn APIs and achieved an accuracy score of 1 in classifying breast cancer observations.
